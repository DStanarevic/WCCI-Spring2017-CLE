## Topics
## Goals
- Examine loop programming constructs.
- Implement conditional repetitions (while and do-while loops).
- Work with for-loops. 
- Explore different loop definitions and constructions.
- Understand some key usages of loops.
- Learn about foreach-loops.
- Understand how to use multiple loops placed inside each other (nested loops).
#### Loops
 - What is a loop?
 - When would you use a loop?
 - Why would you use a loop?
 - Nested Loops
 - Infinite Loops
 - Keywords: `break` & `continue`
 #### For Loop
 - When to use a for loop
   - Counting
   - Iterating through a collection
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a for loop
   - keyword: `for`
   - initializer
   - condition
   - updater
#### Foreach Loop
 - When to use a foreach loop
   - Iterating through a collection
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a foreach loop
   - Keywords: `in`, `foreach`
#### Do While Loop
 - When to use a do while loop
   - Want a chunk of code to run once regardless, but then run multiple times after if a condition is met
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a do while
   - keywords: `do`, `while`
#### While Loop
 - When to use a while loop
   - Want a chunk of code to run only if a condition is met first
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a while loop
   - keyword: `while`
   
## Practice
### Do It
- Create an array called days with the elements Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Using a For Loop, print the elements of the days array.
- Start with the string "Once upon a time" and create an array called storyWords using the Split method. Reverse the order of the elements in the array and using a For Loop, print each word.
