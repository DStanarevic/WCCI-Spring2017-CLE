## Homework

Tonight's homework will involve designing tables in SQL Server Management Studio.

- Create one table to collect Employee Information for a new hire. What fields would you include? What data types for those fields 
  should you use?
- Design two tables that demonstrate the relationship between an individual author and her book, with at least four fields in each table.
- Design three tables to illustrate the following relationship: 
  - An animal shelter needs to keep track of their adoptions. 
    - They would like to keep information for each animal (type of animal, breed, and three other fields) 
    - Each family who is adopting (whether or not they have a fenced in yard, if they have other pets, and three other fields) 
    - And a record of each adoption (which family adopted which animal, the date of the adoption, and three other fields).
